## **Find Your Hat** 

### Original idea adapted from a codeacademy project, found on www.codecademy.com.

<div style="text-align:center"><image src="images/Gameplay.png"></div>

## Aim
Move the * character to the ^ hat.

## Controls
Use w, s, a, d to move up, down, left, and right respectively. **After each button press, press enter to make the move.

## Issues
- Currently has a bug when dimensions greater than aproximately 20 are triggered, win condition is immediate.

## Future Build Objectives
- Create a difficulty setting, based on how many obstacles will be generated as a percentage.
- Create a map initializer that checks that map is winnable.
- Create dynamic, random, mob obstacles optional for each game.
- Add in an AI, competing against the player.

## Release Notes
Feel free to download, modify and use this game however you wish.
